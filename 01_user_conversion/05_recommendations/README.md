# Product Recommendations

This phase translates the validated insights from previous phases
into **clear, prioritized product recommendations**.

The objective is not to enumerate ideas,
but to propose **decisions that are grounded in evidence,
aware of trade-offs, and suitable for experimentation**.

---

## Purpose of this phase

After completing signal definition (Phase 3) and modeling & insights (Phase 4),
the remaining question is:

> Given what we know, **what should the product team actually do next?**

This phase focuses on:
- Turning insights into concrete actions
- Making trade-offs explicit
- Prioritizing impact over completeness
- Defining how recommendations would be validated in practice

---

## Principles guiding recommendations

All recommendations in this phase adhere to the following principles:

1. **Evidence-backed**  
   Each recommendation is directly linked to one or more validated insights.

2. **Actionable**  
   Recommendations map to specific product surfaces, flows, or levers.

3. **Testable**  
   No recommendation is treated as a final answer; all are framed as hypotheses.

4. **Prioritized**  
   Fewer, high-confidence actions are preferred over broad idea lists.

5. **Risk-aware**  
   Potential downsides and uncertainty are explicitly acknowledged.

## Scope and non-goals

### In scope
- Product and UX recommendations
- Monetization and sequencing strategies
- Experiment design and validation logic
- Trade-offs between impact, effort, and risk

### Out of scope
- Detailed implementation specs
- Engineering-level task breakdowns
- Guaranteed outcome claims
- Organization-specific constraints

## Structure of this phase

This phase is organized into the following components:

1. **Decision framework**  
   How recommendations are evaluated and prioritized.

2. **Recommendation set**  
   A small number of concrete, high-impact product actions.

3. **Experiment design**  
   How each recommendation would be validated.

4. **Success metrics and risks**  
   How outcomes are measured and what could go wrong.

Each component is documented separately to preserve clarity.

---

## Expected outcomes

By the end of this phase, we expect to have:

- A concise set of product recommendations
- Clear linkage between insights and actions
- Explicit assumptions and risks
- A validation plan suitable for real-world execution

This phase concludes the analytical case study
and sets the stage for execution and iteration.
