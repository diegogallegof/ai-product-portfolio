# AI Product Portfolio

This repository documents my applied work at the intersection of
**Product Management, Data Science, and AI**, focused on subscription
and streaming products.

The goal of this portfolio is not to showcase advanced models or production-ready
systems, but to demonstrate **how data and machine learning can responsibly support
product decisions** in real-world contexts.

This work reflects how I think as a Product Manager when using data and AI
to make decisions under real constraints.

My background spans engineering, software development, and over a decade building
and operating subscription and streaming products at scale. This portfolio reflects
a product-first approach to AI: focusing on metrics, trade-offs, assumptions,
and decision impact.
