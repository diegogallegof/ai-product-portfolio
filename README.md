# AI Product Portfolio

This repository documents my journey and applied work at the intersection of
**Product Management, Data Science, and AI**.

The goal of this portfolio is not to showcase advanced models or production-ready
systems, but to demonstrate **how data and machine learning can responsibly support
product decisions** in real-world contexts.

My background spans engineering, software development, and over a decade building
subscription and streaming products. This work reflects a product-first approach
to AI: focusing on metrics, trade-offs, assumptions, and decision impact.

## 🎯 What this portfolio is about

This is not a collection of tutorials or isolated notebooks.

Each project in this repository:
- Starts from a **real product problem**
- Defines success through **business and product metrics**
- Applies Data Science and Machine Learning as **decision-support tools**
- Explicitly documents **assumptions, limitations, and risks**
- Ends with **product insights and recommendations**

Accuracy alone is never the objective — **clarity and judgment are**.

## 🧠 Guiding principles

- AI is a **means**, not an end.
- Simpler models are often more useful for product decisions.
- Interpretability and context matter more than marginal performance gains.
- Every model introduces bias, risk, and opportunity cost.
- Product judgment does not disappear when models appear.

## 🧭 How to read this work

If you are reviewing this portfolio:
1. Start with the **case README**
2. Review the **notebooks for reasoning, not code style**
3. Read the **insights.md** for product conclusions
4. Pay attention to **what is explicitly *not* claimed**

---

This portfolio is intentionally built **in public**, evolving over time as my
understanding of AI, data, and product decision-making deepens.
